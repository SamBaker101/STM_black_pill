# STM Black Pill Experiments

## Background

I've had an STM Black Pill in my parts drawer for a while now that I've never had the chance to play with. Im hoping to use this board for a larger project I'm planning but want to spend some time with it first. The purpose of this repo is to run through some basic functional programs (blinky, motor control, sensor input, serial comms ect.) to become more familiar with this board and STM's software suite.

## Hardware

STM Black Pill : STM32F401CCU6

ST-Link V2

## Targets

    - Blinky 
    - Motor Controller
    - Read Data from Sensors
    - Serial Communication (2-way)
